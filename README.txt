This simulator simulates job processing and scheduling using Round Robin algorithms and multi-level priority feedback queues along with simulated memory (800K)using best-fit algorithm and a partition table, along with a secondary memory that will house 300 jobs. This	simulates job scheduling in an operating system with optimized results. Simulates scheduling based on job type, job number, memory and runtime needed. Create your own data file (text file) with the format below to do this. Final statistics will be printed to the output window while individual job statistics will be displayed in a logfile.
		
	make sure data file has the following format
	1 2 320 2
  2 5 10 2
	First entry is the job number, second entry is either 1,2, or 3 (CPU, balanced, or mixed job)
	third entry is main memory needed, fourth entry is maximum run time
  
	enter name of data file along with extension (make sure it is in Phase 2 Folder,otherwise type location of file as well
Individual job statistics are now in logfile.txt in folder
